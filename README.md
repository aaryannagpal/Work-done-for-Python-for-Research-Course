# Work done for Python for Research Course

I did a course on edX platform known as **Python for Research** by Harvard University. To make track of the work I did there, I made this repository.

Of course, there can be mistakes in the actual answers, or more efficient codes to the ones I have written, so just keep in mind if you choose to reference them.
